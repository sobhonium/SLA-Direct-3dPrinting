If using this project's tool, you don't need to download and place UVtools manually in here.
By running .sh it does it automatically for you.


Now, if you want to manually use and test this tool (for conversion especially) do this:


Download UVtools_linux-x64_v3.13.1.zip from https://github.com/sn4k3/UVtools/releases/tag/v3.13.1
put it in a desired directory and open terminal in that directory
unzip the file.
To make sure if it is the one, make sure it contains the UVtoolsCMd file in that.
run the 
>>> UVtoolsCMD --version


if it works follow up the rest on https://github.com/sn4k3/UVtools#command-line

./UVtoolsCmd convert <path-input-file>.sl1s pwmb <path-input-file>.pwmb
